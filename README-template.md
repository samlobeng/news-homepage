## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Bootstrap 5.2

### What I learned

I learned bootstrap grid system and various bootstrap utility classes. I learned how to use various bootstrap components like navbar.
I also learned about complex css selectors.
```css
.description p:first-of-type{
    color: hsl(240, 100%, 5%);
    font-weight: 800;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
}
.description p:first-of-type:hover{
   color: hsl(5, 85%, 63%);
   cursor: pointer;
   transition: color .3s;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue to understand the mobile first design system.
